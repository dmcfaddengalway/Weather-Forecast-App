# CORS Issue (September 7th, 2017)

As GitHub Pages does not allow Cross browser Origin Sharing, I am unable to pull IP address information for the API calls. This in turn will crash the entire application and fails to show any data. Screenshots will be uploaded to see what the app looks like with data in it when run locally. I have looked into several options to see if GHP allows a user to work around this.
